### Beans and BeanFactory
 - BeanFactory is responsible for managing components, including their dependencies as well as their life cycles
 - DefaultListableBeanFactory
```java
public class XmlConfigWithBeanFactory {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        DefaultListableBeanFactory factory = new DefaultListableBeanFactory();
        XmlBeanDefinitionReader rdr = new XmlBeanDefinitionReader(factory);
        rdr.loadBeanDefinitions(new ClassPathResource("spring/xml-bean-factory-config.xml"));
        Oracle oracle = (Oracle) factory.getBean("oracle");
        System.out.println(oracle.defineMeaningOfLife());
    }
}
```
```
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:c="http://www.springframework.org/schema/c"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
                           http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context.xsd">

    <bean id="oracle"
        name="wiseworm"
        class="com.apress.prospring5.ch3.BookwormOracle"/>
    </bean>
</beans>
```

### ApplicationContext
 - Extends BeanFactory
 - Loaded via bootstrapping with manual code or via ContextLoaderListener
 
##### Config Options
 - XML
 - Annotations
```
<context:component-scan base-package="com.apress.prospring5.ch3.annotation"/>

@Component
@Controller
@Repository
@Service
@Autowired
@Inject
@Resource 
```

#### Mixed, XML + Java cfg, integrates legacy
```java
@ImportResource(locations = {"classpath:spring/app-context-xml.xml"})
@Configuration
public class HelloWorldConfiguration {
}
```

### Avoid Field Injection
But there are drawbacks, and this is why using field injection is usually avoided
 - Although it is easy to add dependencies this way, we must be careful not to violate the
   single responsibility principle. Having more dependencies means more responsibilities
   for a class, which might lead to a difficulty of separating concerns at refactoring time.
   The situation when a class becomes bloated is easier to see when dependencies are set
   using constructors or setters but is quite well hidden when using field injection
 - The responsibility of injecting dependencies is passed to the container in Spring,
   but the class should clearly communicate the type of dependencies needed using
   a public interface, through methods or constructors. Using field injections, it can
   become unclear what type of dependency is really needed and if the dependency is
   mandatory or not.
 - Field injection introduces a dependency of the Spring container, as the @Autowired
   annotation is a Spring component; thus, the bean is no longer a POJO and cannot be
   instantiated independently.
 - Field injection cannot be used for final fields. This type of fields can only be initialized using
   constructor injection
 - Field injection introduces difficulties when writing tests as the dependencies have to
   be injected manually


#### Bean Naming
 - Every bean must have at least one name that is unique within the containing ApplicationContext
 
Resolution
 1. Looks for id
 2. Looks for name (first one defined)
 3. If no ID and no name - uses the class name
 4. If there are multiple beans without name and ids of the same class - throws NoSuchBeanDefinitionException) on injection during ApplicationContext initialization
 ```
<beans ...>
    <bean id="string1" class="java.lang.String"/>
    <bean name="string2" class="java.lang.String"/>
    <bean class="java.lang.String"/>
</beans>
```
As a general practice, you should give your bean a name by using the id attribute and then associate the bean with other names by using name aliasing

#### Bean Aliasing
You can achieve this by specifying a space-, comma-, or semicolon-separated list of names in the name attribute of the beanâ€™s <bean> tag.
```
<bean id="person"
      name="person1,person2,person3"
      class="com.idenchev.classes.alias.Person"/>
<alias name="person" alias="xmlBeanAliasForPerson"/>
```
// 98 str
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("beans.xml");

    Person p0 = (Person) ctx.getBean("person");
    Person p1 = (Person) ctx.getBean("person1");
    Person p2 = (Person) ctx.getBean("person2");
    Person p3 = (Person) ctx.getBean("person3");
    Person p4 = (Person) ctx.getBean("xmlBeanAliasForPerson");

    Map<String, Person> people = ctx.getBeansOfType(Person.class);

    System.out.println(p0 == p1);             // true
    System.out.println(p1 == p2);             // true
    System.out.println(p2 == p3);             // true
    System.out.println(p3 == p4);             // true
    System.out.println(people.size() == 1);   // true
}
```



#### Annotation Naming
Basic
```java
// Unnamed
@Component
public class Singer {}
// id: singer

// Named
@Component("theSinger")
public class Singer {}
// id: theSinger
```

With Aliases
```java
@Configuration
public static class AliasBeanConfig {
    @Bean(name={"johnMayer","john","jonathan","johnny"})
    public Singer singer(){ return new Singer(); }
}
// id: johnMayer
// aliases: jonathan, johnny, john
```



#### Autowiring
 - byName
   - When using byName autowiring, Spring attempts to wire each property to a
     bean of the same name. So, if the target bean has a property named foo and a foo
     bean is defined in ApplicationContext, the foo bean is assigned to the foo property
     of the target
 
 - byType
   - When using byType autowiring, Spring attempts to wire each of the
     properties on the target bean by automatically using a bean of the same type in
     ApplicationContext.
     
 - constructor
   - This functions just like byType wiring, except that it uses constructors
     rather than setters to perform the injection. Spring attempts to match the
     greatest numbers of arguments it can in the constructor. So, if your bean has two
     constructors, one that accepts a String and one that accepts String and an Integer,
     and you have both a String and an Integer bean in your ApplicationContext,
     Spring uses the two-argument constructor.
 
 - default
   - Spring will choose between the constructor and byType modes
     automatically. If your bean has a default (no-arguments) constructor, Spring uses
     byType; otherwise, it uses constructor
 
 - no
   - default
